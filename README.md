# Alex JJ Green

*Self-taught,* *initially* *just* *for* *the* *fun* *of* *the* *challenge* *but* *now* *looking* *to* *'go* *pro'*

I work almost exclusively in Python and JS. My philosophy is that there's probably a specific language that can do a specific task better but the 2nd best option is usually Python so just use that for the whole project instead and abstract out that complexity.

Currently working on building automations for different workflows at my dayjob, this mostly involves automating outlook functionalities, getting data from pdfs, parsing that and converting it usable formats, most commonly dataframes and excel sheets.

The big learns at the moment are fintech programming paradigms, ie. blockchain and AI tech, although I have a pretty substantial grasp of the Flask backend as well, as every project inevitably comes back to web-dev in some way shape or form.

If you wanna chat, don't hesitate, shoot me an email.

LG,
